## Problem statement
To improve customer service efficiency and satisfaction, to analyze call center performance metrics, including agent responsiveness, call resolution, talk time and resolution rate. The goal is to identify patterns, bottlenecks, and high performing agents to inform training, staffing and operational decisions.

# Business Objectives 
### Monitor overall and per agent performance in terms of;
  - Answer rate
  - Resolution rate
  - Speed of answer
  - Average talk duration
### Satisfaction rate
  -	Identify trends over time 
  -	Optimize staffing levels by understanding call volumes and patterns
  -	Discover relationship between response/resolution time and customer satisfaction
  -	Identify top-performing and underperforming agents
  -	Optimze staffing level by understanding call volumes and patterns.
## Process
  - Defined project scope.
  - Data Cleaning; Standardized data to ensure consistency in data type, data format and value consistency. Thorougly
    exxamined the data to identify missing values, anomalies and inconsistency.
  - Utilised DAX formulas to create calculated column and measures.
  - Leveraged Power Query to clean, transform and shape data.

## Project Insights
  - Speed vs. Satisfaction: Analysis reveals that speed of answer does not significantly impact customer satisfaction rate, indicating 
    that other factors are at play.
  - Low Satisfaction Rating: The average satisfaction rate across all agentis low, highlighting the need for improvement.

## Recommendation
   To boost performance and satisfaction rate, I recommend providing agents with;
    - Targetted Training: Equip agents with skills and knowledge needed to effectively address customers concerns
    - Incentives: Implement incentives to motivate agents and recognize exceptional performance.
